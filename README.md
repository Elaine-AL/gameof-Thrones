# Game of Thrones characters analysis
This is an analysis of characters for game of thrones using **Power BI** for visualization. I used the datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/game-of-thrones) for the analyses, containing Battles, character deaths and character predictions csv files.


### Battles analysis
* From the graphs you can see that King Joffrey Baratheon and King Robb Stark were the most active when it comes to war since they were involved in so many battles. In contrary, King Mance and King Renly have never initiated any war, hence can be termed as peaceful leaders.
* It can be seen King Joffrey loved planned battles while King Robb loved to ambush his enemies.
* Most of the battles took place in The Riverlands while there was only one occurence Beyond the Wall because of the presence of the White walkers.
* All the attacking kings won most of their innitiated wars but King Balon has never lost. On the other hand, King Mance lost a war the one time he had defended.
* Most of the battles took place during summer.

### Character deaths
* It can be seen that most characters were pledged their loyalty to the Nights Watch because of Jon Snow, most people believed in him. While the least pledged their allegiance to the House of Tyrell since it was extinct.
* Most of the characters died in 299, that is, almost the end of the series.
* Most of the characters were male taking 82% of the total.
* The introduction of characters based on chapters was occassional but kept reducing to avoid overpopulating the series with too many people.
* Most deaths occurred between chapters 30 to 50 when there were many people fighting for the same Iron Throne.
_Use the name of characters and Book of death as slicers to find information about each character_

### Character predictions
* According to predictions, most deaths would occurr in 299 which is true as seen in the above character deaths analysis.
* Most characters were born between 230 and 290.
* Most characters are aged between 15 and 24. This is weird as i had expected them to be between 24 to 30.

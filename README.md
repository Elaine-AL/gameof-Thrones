# Game of Thrones characters analysis
This is an analysis of characters for game of thrones using **Power BI** for visualization. I used the datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/game-of-thrones) for the analyses, containing Battles, character deaths and character predictions csv files.


### Battles analysis
* From the graphs you can see that King Joffrey Baratheon and King Robb Stark were the most active when it comes to war since they were involved in so many battles. In contrary, King Mance and King Renly have never initiated any war, hence can be termed as peaceful leaders.
* It can be seen King Joffrey loved planned battles while King Robb loved to ambush his enemies.
* Most of the battles took place in The Riverlands while there was only one occurence Beyond the Wall because of the presence of the White walkers.
* All the attacking kings won most of their innitiated wars but King Balon has never lost. On the other hand, King Mance lost a war the one time he had defended.
* Most of the battles took place during summer.
